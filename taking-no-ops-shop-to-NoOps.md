Title: A case study: Taking SaaS shop from no ops to NoOps
==========================
I was hired by a client to bring their new SaaS offering to production.  
At this time they had no operations guy on staff to run it.  
While working on the project, I asked the CTO and myself if it is possible
to deploy methodologies and infrastructure that would enable this company
to support their production without a designated ops guy.  
This is a story of our journey.
